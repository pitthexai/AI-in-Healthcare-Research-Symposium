# AI in Healthcare Research Symposium 2025 Tutorial: De-biased Medical Imaging Analytics

<p align="justify">De-biasing in medical image analysis is a critical aspect of developing AI and deep learning models that are both fair and effective in healthcare settings. For instance, accurate and reliable segmentation of medical images is essential for precise disease diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and effective patient monitoring. However, when bias is not adequately addressed, these AI models can inadvertently perpetuate disparities and inequities in healthcare delivery. De-biasing medical image segmentation ensures that AI algorithms do not discriminate against individuals based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, or any other demographic factors. It aims to provide equitable healthcare outcomes for all patients, irrespective of their background or characteristics.</p> 

<p align="justify">Upholding de-biasing practices in AI models for medical image segmentation is not only an ethical imperative but also crucial for building trust in AI systems within the medical community and among patients. Transparent and accountable AI algorithms, coupled with comprehensive data collection and evaluation, can help identify and rectify biases in the training data or the algorithmic decision-making process. This iterative process of refinement and evaluation ensures that AI models produce consistent and unbiased results, contributing to the overall quality and fairness of healthcare delivery. This tutorial mainly aims to provide hands-on practices in building de-biased and accurate deep learning models for image segmentation, focusing on knee bony anatomy segmentation using plain radiographs.</p>


### Dataset
<p align="justify">We will be using knee (X-rays) that are publicly available through the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/oai" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)</a>. You may want to create an account there and download knee images. However, in this GitHub repository, we provide you with a sample subset of the images with manual segmentation masks. During the tutorial, we will be mainly using this sample data.</p>
