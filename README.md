# AI in Healthcare Research Symposium 2025 Tutorial: De-biased and Explainable Medical Imaging Analytics

<p align="justify">De-biasing and explainability in medical image analysis are critical components of developing AI and deep learning models that are both fair and effective in healthcare settings. For example, accurate and reliable segmentation of medical images is essential for precise disease diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and effective patient monitoring. However, when bias is not adequately addressed, these AI models can inadvertently perpetuate disparities and inequities in healthcare delivery. De-biasing medical image segmentation ensures that AI algorithms do not discriminate against individuals based on factors such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, or other demographic characteristics, ultimately striving to provide equitable healthcare outcomes for all patients, regardless of their background.</p> 

<p align="justify">Explainability in AI models for medical image segmentation is essential for fostering trust within the medical community and among patients. Transparent, explainable, and accountable AI algorithms, along with comprehensive data collection and evaluation, help identify and address biases in training data and decision-making processes. By incorporating explainability, we ensure that the reasoning behind AI decisions is accessible and understandable, allowing healthcare providers to trust and act on the AI's output. This iterative process of refinement, explanation, and evaluation ensures that AI models produce consistent, unbiased results, improving the quality, fairness, and interpretability of healthcare delivery. This tutorial aims to provide hands-on experience in developing de-biased, accurate, and explainable deep learning models for image segmentation, with a focus on knee bony anatomy segmentation using plain radiographs.</p>


### Dataset
<p align="justify">We will be using knee (X-rays) that are publicly available through the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/oai" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)</a>. You may want to create an account there and download knee images. However, in this GitHub repository, we provide you with a sample subset of the images with manual segmentation masks. During the tutorial, we will be mainly using this sample data.</p>
